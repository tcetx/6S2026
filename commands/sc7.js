üéØ Learning Objective:
Implementation of Simple Genetic Algorithm.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools:
Python

üìñ Theory:
One example of a simple genetic application is the breeding of plants and animals to produce desirable traits. This process is often referred to as selective breeding or artificial selection.

In selective breeding, individuals with desirable traits are chosen to breed and produce offspring with those desirable traits. Over time, this can lead to the development of new varieties or breeds of plants and animals that exhibit specific characteristics.

For example, farmers may selectively breed cows for increased milk production or selectively breed crops for greater resistance to pests or drought. Similarly, dog breeders may selectively breed dogs for specific physical and behavioral traits.

This process is similar to natural selection, where certain traits that are advantageous for survival and reproduction become more common in a population over time. However, in selective breeding, humans are deliberately choosing which traits to promote and which to eliminate, rather than relying on natural selection.

The use of genetic engineering is another example of a genetic application. Genetic engineering involves manipulating the DNA of an organism to introduce new traits or modify existing ones. This can be done by inserting or deleting genes, or by altering the expression of existing genes.

For example, scientists may use genetic engineering to create crops that are more resistant to pests or produce higher yields, or to create bacteria that can produce useful chemicals or enzymes. Genetic engineering is also used in medical research to create new treatments for genetic diseases or to develop vaccines.

üìå Algorithm:
1. Select Np individuals from the previous population.
2. Create the mating pool randomly.
3. Perform Crossover.
4. Perform Mutation in offspring solutions.
5. Perform inversion in offspring solutions.
6. Replace the old solutions of the last generation with the newly created solutions and go to step (2).
